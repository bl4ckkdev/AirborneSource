# Airborne Source Code
 ~70% of Airborne's codebase, for modding purposes.
Only code that's removed is Steamworks code which is (probably) under an NDA. The rest is directly from Airborne.
This code is shit. Only use it for reference when making mods

# Structure
Essentially, four most important scripts
- MainEditorComponent.cs — Handles all level editor backend
- EditorControls.cs — Handles level editor UI
- ObjectComponent.cs — Handles every object instance individually
- CharacterController2D.cs / PlayerMovement.cs
